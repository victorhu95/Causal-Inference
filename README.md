## Week 2 Overview
Details of what to expect in the second week of the course or project.

## Two Main Ways to Study Cause and Effect
1. **The Classical Paradigm**
2. **Potential Outcomes Paradigm**

## The Classical Paradigm
### Bradford Hill Criteria
1. **Strength**
2. **Consistency**
3. **Specificity**
4. **Timing**
5. **Gradient**
6. **Plausibility**
7. **Coherence**
8. **Analogy**
9. **Experimental Evidence**

### Applying the Classical Approach
1. **Observation**
2. **Gather More Information**
3. **Apply Bradford Hill Criteria**
4. **Make a Judgment**

### Example: Air Pollution and Health
1. **Gathering Evidence**
2. **Review by Authorities**
3. **Judging the Evidence**
4. **Final Statement**

## Potential Outcomes Paradigm
### Rubin Causal Model
1. **Think of Possible Outcomes**
2. **How Are Treatments Given**
3. **Model for The Science**

## Traditional Statistics vs. Causal Inference
- **What Statistics Usually Does: Associational Inference**
- **What Causal Inference Usually Does**

## Potential Outcomes vs. Classical Paradigms
1. **What is the Cause?**
2. **What is the Effect?**

## Foundational Concepts
### Units
- **Objects of Study**
- **Statistical Population**
- **Key Variables**

### Treatment
- **Definition**
- **Thinking Experimentally**
- **Key Feature**
- **Contrast with Attributes**
- **Role of Time**

### Causes
1. **Experimental Treatments as Causes**
2. **Relative Effects**
3. **Not Limited to Randomized Studies**

### Potential Outcomes
- **\(Y^t_i\), \(Y^c_i\), \(Y^Z_i\)**
- **Innate Characteristics Before Treatment**
- **Assignment to \(Z\) Determines Observed Outcome**
- **Relationship Between Potential Outcomes and Observed Data**
